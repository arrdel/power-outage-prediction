              Predicting power outages in advance is critical for enhancing public safety, expediting emergency
              response, reducing economic losses, and minimizing damage to electrical infrastructure. During natural
              disasters and extreme weather events, power systems face elevated risks, making accurate and timely
              predictions essential. This paper introduces <strong>GraPO</strong>, a novel spatial-temporal graph
              neural network (GNN) approach designed to predict county-level power outage risk and severity during
              and after extreme weather events. We construct a spatial graph where each U.S. county is represented
              as a node, and edges encode the topology of the national electric transmission network based on publicly
              available datasets. GraPO integrates a rich set of node features derived from historical outage records
              (EAGLE-I), real-time and forecasted climate data (ERA5), severe weather alerts (NWS VTEC), and
              county-level socio-demographic attributes. By embedding spatial-temporal dynamics through weather event
              sequences and grid connectivity, GraPO models how outage risks propagate across the network. We evaluate
              the model using three years of historical data covering multiple storm, heatwave, and dark calm events.
              Results show that GraPO consistently outperforms traditional machine learning baselines, providing earlier
              and more accurate outage risk predictions. We also discuss practical implications, limitations related to
              data sparsity in rural regions, and future directions for improving predictive robustness and real-time
              deployment.

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Power outages significantly impact economic stability, critical infrastructure integrity, public safety,
              and the overall quality of life. Annually, these disruptions result in billions of dollars in economic
              losses, infrastructure damages, and increased risks to public welfare. Severe weather events such as
              hurricanes, floods, and thunderstorms are frequent causes of power outages, often overwhelming
              traditional forecasting methods that rely heavily on historical outage data and simplistic statistical
              relationships. The complexity and interconnectedness of modern power grids, coupled with the
              escalating frequency of extreme weather due to climate change, underscore the urgent need for
              advanced predictive capabilities to anticipate and mitigate power outages.
            </p>

            <p>
              Traditional prediction methods, including statistical modeling and classical machine learning algorithms
              such as random forests and gradient boosting, have provided useful but limited insights. These methods
              typically neglect essential spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics intrinsic to power grids, leading
              to limited predictive accuracy and limited actionable insights.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Graph neural networks (GNNs)</strong> offer promising solutions by explicitly modeling
              relationships and interactions across networked data structures. GNNs excel in capturing intricate
              patterns across interconnected nodes, making them highly suitable for spatially and temporally structured
              data. Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), in particular, have demonstrated significant
              efficacy in various applications including traffic prediction, infrastructure monitoring, and energy
              management.
            </p>

            <p>
              To address the critical gaps in existing methodologies, this study proposes <strong>GraPO</strong>, a
              sophisticated GNN-based model specifically designed to predict the locations and severities of power
              outages approximately <strong>12 hours in advance</strong>. Our approach integrates multiple,
              heterogeneous datasets including comprehensive climate data (ERA5), detailed US power grid topology,
              historical power outage occurrences (EAGLE-I), and real-time weather alerts from the National Weather
              Service (NWS VTEC archives). The resulting predictive model offers a strategic advantage to utility
              companies, emergency response organizations, and policymakers by providing early and accurate predictions,
              allowing for proactive and effective management of resources and responses.

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">EAGLE-I Outage Data</h3>
            <p>
              We utilize county-level outage counts from the <strong>EAGLE-I™ (Environment for Analysis of
                Geo-Located Energy Information)</strong> dataset maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This
              dataset provides comprehensive power outage information across the United States from 2014 to 2023,
              containing information on the number of customers without power every 15 minutes at the county level.
              Each model's input features comprise: (1) the maximum number of county outages over the 12-hour period
              preceding each weather alert issuance; (2) the categorical weather alert type; and (3) the list of
              counties impacted by the alert.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">ERA5 Climate Reanalysis Data</h3>
            <p>
              We use the <strong>ERA5 Single Level Reanalysis</strong> dataset, hosted by the Google Cloud Public
              Datasets program via the <code>arco-era5</code> archive. This dataset provides hourly global weather
              reanalysis fields produced by ECMWF on a native N320 reduced Gaussian grid (~25 km resolution).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our analysis focuses on a single calendar year (2022), which includes 8,760 hourly timesteps. We
              partition the data chronologically, using the first 70% (January 1 to September) for training, 10% for
              validation, and the remaining 20% for testing. This split preserves temporal coherence and reflects
              realistic forecasting conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dataset includes a wide range of atmospheric and surface variables:
            </p>
            <ul class="data-list">
              <li><strong>Surface meteorology:</strong> 2-meter temperature, dewpoint, surface pressure, mean sea
                level pressure</li>
              <li><strong>Wind components:</strong> at 10m and 100m height</li>
              <li><strong>Cloud cover:</strong> low, medium, high, and total cloud cover</li>
              <li><strong>Water and energy fluxes:</strong> total column water vapor, cloud liquid water, convective
                available potential energy (CAPE)</li>
              <li><strong>Soil and snow fields:</strong> soil temperature and moisture (layers 1-4), snow temperature
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sea state:</strong> sea surface temperature, sea ice fraction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">County-Level Spatial Data</h3>
            <p>
              To produce county-level weather data, we use the <strong>US Census Bureau boundary files</strong> for
              each US county. We compute the centroid of each county using an average of all sides of the polygon's
              coordinates weighted by side length. To convert the ERA5 weather data from a grid to county-level data,
              we use <strong>Delaunay triangulation</strong>, the dual of Voronoi tessellation, to get a set of
              triangular surfaces with ERA5 grid points making up the vertices. For each county centroid, we find
              which surface it falls upon then use the weather data corresponding to the vertices of the triangle to
              interpolate a value for that county.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Power Grid Topology</h3>
            <p>
              We leverage the <strong>US Power Transmission Line Dataset</strong> from the Department of Energy,
              which provides precise geographic start and end points for transmission lines across the United States.
              Each power line segment is geographically mapped to the counties it traverses, enabling us to construct
              a graph where edges represent physical electrical connections between counties.

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Our approach, <strong>GraPO</strong>, integrates spatial-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) to
              predict power outage locations and severities approximately 12 hours in advance. The methodology
              consists of four key components: graph construction, node embedding initialization, model architecture
              design, and model training and evaluation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Graph Construction</h3>
            <p>
              The foundational step in our methodology is the detailed construction of a spatially explicit graph
              representing all US counties, interconnected through transmission lines. To create this structure, we
              leverage the US Power Transmission Line Dataset, which provides precise geographic start and end points
              for transmission lines. Each power line segment is geographically mapped to the counties it traverses.
              Edges between county nodes in the resulting graph are established where transmission lines directly
              connect counties. Additionally, each edge is assigned a weight corresponding to the voltage level of its
              associated power line, effectively capturing varying strengths of connectivity within the power grid.
              This graph structure embodies the intricate interdependencies inherent in electrical infrastructure and
              serves as a spatial foundation for predictive modeling.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Node Embeddings Initialization</h3>
            <p>
              Each node in the graph corresponds to a US county and is initialized with rich, multi-source embeddings
              to effectively capture both static and dynamic county-level characteristics. We aggregate climate
              features from the ERA5 dataset, which includes critical weather parameters such as temperature, wind
              speed, and precipitation. This aggregation occurs by calculating each county's centroid and extracting
              climate information from the four nearest ERA5 data points, thus providing robust local climatic
              representations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, we enrich these embeddings by incorporating static demographic and geographic features from
              publicly available county datasets. Historical power outage information from the EAGLE-I dataset also
              forms a critical part of each node's embedding, providing the temporal context necessary for prediction
              tasks. Finally, we integrate event-specific weather advisories from the NWS Valid Time Extent Code
              (VTEC) archives, dynamically capturing real-time alert data relevant to outage occurrences.
              Collectively, these embeddings represent comprehensive county-specific features, essential for
              accurately modeling complex outage dynamics.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              To explore the predictive performance and generalization capabilities of various GNN configurations, we
              design and evaluate modeling approaches with varying architectures:
            </p>
            <ul class="data-list">
              <li><strong>Encoder:</strong> We compare a Temporal Transformer encoder to a simple feedforward network
                used as a baseline.</li>
              <li><strong>Graph Neural Network (GNN) Layer:</strong> We evaluate both Graph Convolutional Networks
                (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs). The GCN aggregates information uniformly from neighboring
                nodes, whereas the GAT introduces learned attention coefficients to dynamically weight node
                interactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition to the architectural components, we incorporate a learnable county-specific bias term to
              capture static characteristics and persistent outage tendencies. The final model output is computed as:
            </p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
              $$
              \hat{y}_{i,t+h} = \phi\left( \text{GNN} \left( \left\{\text{TemporalEncoder}\left(X_{t-w:t}^{(i)}\right) +
              c^{(i)} \mid X_{t-w:t}^{(i)} \in \mathbf{X}, c^{(i)} \in C\right\}, \text{E} \right) \right)
              $$
            </div>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul class="data-list">
              <li>$\hat{y}_{i,t+h}$ is the predicted target value for county $i$ at forecast horizon $h$</li>
              <li>$X_{t-w:t}^{(i)} \in \mathbf{X}$ denotes the input weather features for county $i$ over the
                historical window $[t-w, t]$</li>
              <li>$\text{E}$ is the edge list</li>
              <li>$\text{TemporalEncoder}$ is the temporal transformer layer</li>
              <li>$\text{GNN}$ is a spatial layer (GCN or GAT)</li>
              <li>$\phi$ is the feedforward decoder</li>
              <li>$c_i$ is a learnable county embedding vector for county $i$</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Training Objective and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
              Our primary training objective is to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted and
              actual customer outage counts per county, forecasting 12 hours in advance. Specifically, the RMSE loss
              function, defined as:
            </p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
              $$
              \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}
              $$
            </div>
            <p>
              quantitatively measures model predictive accuracy, where $y_i$ and $\hat{y_i}$ denote true and
              predicted outage counts, respectively. To rigorously evaluate model performance, robustness, and
              generalization capacity, we apply a 5-fold cross-validation strategy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Implementation Details</h3>
            <p>
              Models are implemented using the <strong>PyTorch</strong> and <strong>PyTorch Geometric</strong>
              frameworks, leveraging GPU acceleration via NVIDIA GTX 4090 for computationally intensive tasks.
              Hyperparameter optimization is conducted using Bayesian methods, systematically tuning parameters such
              as learning rate, number of hidden units, number of layers, and attention heads, selecting optimal
              configurations based on validation performance. Training durations range from 2 to 8 hours, dependent
              upon the complexity of each model architecture.

            <p>
              To benchmark GraPO's performance against established approaches, we adopt the same state-level machine
              learning methods used by prior work. Specifically, we implement three widely-used regression models:
              <strong>Random Forest (RF)</strong>, <strong>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)</strong>, and
              <strong>Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)</strong>. Following the methodology from existing research,
              we sort events chronologically and allocate the first 80% for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

            <h3 class="subsection-title">GraPO Model Performance</h3>
            <p>
              Our proposed approach, <strong>GraPO</strong>, demonstrates promising potential for accurately predicting
              power outages by effectively modeling spatial and temporal dynamics using graph neural networks. Unlike
              traditional regression models that rely primarily on historical outage patterns and weather alerts, our
              method explicitly incorporates the physical topology of the electrical grid and detailed climate data,
              significantly enhancing predictive capabilities on a more granular task.
            </p>
            <p>
              While prior work has primarily focused on coarser, state-level prediction, our model is trained on a more
              challenging task of forecasting outages at the <strong>county scale across the entire United
                States</strong>.
              Despite the increased granularity and complexity, GraPO achieves a strong RMSE of
              <span class="metric-highlight">9,413.13</span>, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse
              areas of the US. These results highlight the promise of graph-based learning in critical infrastructure
              modeling, particularly that our derived features were informative enough to allow for high predictive
              power.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Key Findings</h3>
            <ul class="data-list">
              <li><strong>Spatial Dependencies Matter:</strong> Incorporating power grid topology through graph
                structure significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to models that treat counties
                independently.</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-Modal Data Integration:</strong> Combining ERA5 climate data, EAGLE-I outage history,
                and NWS weather alerts provides a comprehensive feature set that captures diverse aspects of outage
                risk.</li>
              <li><strong>12-Hour Lead Time:</strong> GraPO successfully predicts outages 12 hours in advance,
                providing sufficient time for utility companies and emergency responders to prepare.</li>
              <li><strong>County-Level Granularity:</strong> Moving from state-level to county-level predictions
                enables more targeted and effective resource allocation.</li>
            </ul>
